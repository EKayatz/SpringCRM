# CRM Dashboard

The CRM dashboard was created with Java Spring Boot and vaadin and offers full CRUD functionality for customer relationship management.
With a pie chart that provides a comprehensive overview of companies.
I also implemented unit testing with JUnit and e2e tests with Vaadin Testbench.

## Running the application

The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvnw` (Windows), or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux), then open
http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more on [how to import Vaadin projects to different IDEs](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/step-by-step/importing) (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, and VS Code).
